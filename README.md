# #30DayMapChallenge

Repository for #30DayMapChallenge, happening in November 2020.

## Topics

*Topics for 2020 will be released 1st of October 2020. Until then you can propose categories on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/tjukanov) or by opening an issue here.* 

## Data

[OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/)

OpenStreetMap (OSM) is a collaborative project to create a free editable map of the world. If you seek for easy ways to get an extract of the data, you can check for [GeoFabrik](https://www.geofabrik.de/data/download.html) for Shapefiles or [osmdata.xyz](https://download.osmdata.xyz/) for GeoPackages.

[Natural Earth Data](https://www.naturalearthdata.com/)

Natural Earth is a public domain map dataset available at 1:10m, 1:50m, and 1:110 million scales. Featuring tightly integrated vector and raster data, with Natural Earth you can make a variety of visually pleasing, well-crafted maps with cartography or GIS software.

[Free GIS Data](https://freegisdata.rtwilson.com/)

The page contains a categorised list of links to over 500 sites providing freely available geographic datasets - all ready for loading into a Geographic Information System.

[OS OpenData](https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/opendatadownload/products.html)

Ordnance Survey Open Data for Great Britain. Includes general topographic map data at a range of scales; useful thematic data such as greenspace, terrain, roads and rivers; postcode and place name georeferencing.

## Tools

Because the challenge is aimed to be open for everyone, the tools listed here will be open source tools. That doesn't mean that the challenge can be done with any kind of software. 

[QGIS](https://www.qgis.org/en/site/)

A Free and Open Source Geographic Information System. A desktop software that allows you to read/write multiple data formats and output (mainly static) maps. 

[Mapshaper](https://mapshaper.org)

Useful for geospatial data processing in the browser such as file format conversion, map projection, feature simplification, filtering, clipping, merging etc. Can also be run [locally from the command line](https://github.com/mbloch/mapshaper).


[Vega-Lite](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/) 

Declarative visualization specification including [cartographic output](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/examples/#maps-geographic-displays). Specifications can be written directly in JSON or via program language interfaces such as [altair](https://altair-viz.github.io) (Python) and [elm-vegalite](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/gicentre/elm-vegalite/latest/VegaLite) (Elm). See, for example, this tutorial on using [OpenStreetMap with elm-vegalite](https://github.com/gicentre/litvis/blob/master/documents/tutorials/geoTutorials/openstreetmap.md)

[Vega](https://vega.github.io/vega/)

More flexible but lower-level declarative visualization specification including cartographic output. Specifications can be written directly in JSON or via program language interfaces such [elm-vega](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/gicentre/elm-vega/latest/).

[Litvis](https://github.com/gicentre/litvis)

Literate Visualization notebook environment optimised for specifying visualizations and documenting the design process. While not specific to cartography, can be a useful environment for exploring cartographic design.

[Observable](https://observablehq.com)

Reactive notebook environment for generation of visualization and cartographic output embedded in a textual narrative. Focus is on using [d3](https://d3js.org) for specifying visual output.
