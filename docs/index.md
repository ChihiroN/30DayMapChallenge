## 🔵 Daily social mapping project happening every November
The official website for #30DayMapChallenge, a daily mapmaking challenge open to everyone.

The idea is to create maps based around different themes each day of November using the hashtag `#30DayMapChallenge`. You can prepare the maps beforehand, but the main idea is to publish maps on the dedicated days. Just include a picture of the map when you post to Twitter (or other platforms) with the hashtag. You don't have to sign up anywhere to participate. There are no restrictions on the tools, technologies or the data you use in your maps. Doing less than 30 is also fine. See the *Code of Conduct* at the bottom of the page.

*Themes for 2022 challenge will be published 1st of October and the challenge will start 1st of November 2022!*

## 🔵 Code of Conduct
No matter if you are a GIS expert or never made a map before, everyone is welcome to participate,

Keep in mind a few things:

 - All maps you publish have to be **your original work**. Don’t steal content from others.
 - Give **credit to the original data source** whenever possible.
 - The challenge is all about **creativity, openness and the joy of beautiful maps and cartography.** It is not a competition.
 - **Don’t be an asshole**

Inspiration for the challenge came from [Inktober](https://inktober.com/) and [Tidy Tuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday).
