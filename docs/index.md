<h1 align="center"><b>#30DayMapChallenge 🌎🌏🌎</b></h1>

## 🔵 Daily social mapping project happening every November
The official website for #30DayMapChallenge, It is a daily mapping/cartography/data visualization challenge aimed at the spatial community.

The idea is to create (and publish) maps based on different themes on each day of the month using the hashtag `#30DayMapChallenge`, You can prepare the maps beforehand, but the main idea is to publish maps from specific topics on specific days listed below. Just include a picture of the map when you post to Twitter with the hashtag. You don't have to sign up anywhere to participate. There are no restrictions on the tools, technologies or the data you use in your maps. Doing less than 30 is also fine (*doing all 30 is really hard!*). See the *Code of Conduct* at the bottom of the page.

Happy mapping!

*Thank you for taking part in the 2021 challenge!*

## 🔵 Code of Conduct
No matter if you are a GIS expert or never made a map before this challenge, everyone is welcome to participate,

But keep in mind a few things:

 - All maps you publish have to be **your original work**. Don’t steal content from others.
 - Give **credit to the original data source** whenever possible.
 - The challenge is all about **creativity, openness and the joy of beautiful maps and cartography.** It is not a competition,
 - **Don’t be an asshole**

Inspiration for the challenge came from [Inktober](https://inktober.com/) and [Tidy Tuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday).
